Christabel,
I understand and will make haste. I have made contact with Annie, and propose we meet at the cafe on Thursday to ensure we have aligned our intents. I propose 11am. The production of the package is proceeding as planned, and I trust you will keep yourself up to date. We should avoid talking too much, many eyes already watch our every step.

Yours,
Emmeline
